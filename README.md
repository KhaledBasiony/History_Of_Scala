# History_Of_Scala

This is my submission for the Datacamp project [***The GitHub History of the Scala Language***](https://www.datacamp.com/projects/163).

In this project we try to analyze the contribution history of developers to the Scala Programming Language Project on Github over the years, to find the most valuable contributors.
